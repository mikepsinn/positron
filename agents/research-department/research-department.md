# Multi-Agent Research Department

## Overview

The Research Department is an integrates multiple OpenAI Assistant agents for conducting collaborative, high-quality research. This system utilizes a team of specialized agents to perform complex research tasks, store results in Markdown and CSV formats, and manage them efficiently through a GitHub repository.

## Features

- **Collaborative Agent System:** Incorporates distinct roles like director, research manager, and research agents.
- **Versatile Data Handling:** Efficiently extracts and processes data, storing results in Markdown and CSV formats within a GitHub repository.
- **Quality Assurance:** A research manager ensures consistent and reliable research outputs.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Designed to be adaptable for various tasks, expanding with additional agents as needed.
- **Customizable Research Methods:** Supports a range of research goals and adapts to different project requirements.

## OpenAI Assistants

Go to https://platform.openai.com/assistants and create the following assistants:

1. **Research Director**:
   - **Role**: The Research Director is responsible for overseeing the entire research process. It extracts a list of companies or topics to research from an Airtable database and breaks them down into individual research tasks.
   - **Tasks**: It delegates these tasks to the Research Manager and Researchers. Once research for a company or topic is completed, the Director updates the company or topic information individually in the Airtable database.
   - **Behavior**: The Research Director ensures that tasks are handled sequentially, updating each task's results before moving on to the next one. This approach helps manage the workload and maintain the quality of research.

2. **Research Manager**:
   - **Role**: The Research Manager acts as a quality controller and planner for the research process.
   - **Tasks**: It generates research plans for given topics and reviews the results delivered by the Researchers. The Manager is critical and persistent, pushing back if the Researchers do not find the necessary information, and suggesting alternative methods or sources for research.
   - **Behavior**: The Research Manager ensures the thoroughness and depth of the research by continuously challenging and guiding the Researchers to explore various sources and methods.

3. **Researcher**:
   - **Role**: The Researcher is the primary agent responsible for conducting the actual research.
   - **Tasks**: It browses the internet, performs Google searches, scrapes websites, and collects data related to the assigned research topics.
   - **Behavior**: The Researcher is instructed to be detailed and factual in its research, exploring multiple iterations of searches and scrapings to gather comprehensive information. It also includes relevant links and references in its reports.

Each of these assistants works in tandem, orchestrated by AutoGen, to complete complex research tasks effectively. The Director manages the overall process, the Manager ensures quality and depth, and the Researchers gather detailed data and information.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Initial Configuration:**
   - Set up distinct GPT assistants: director, research manager, and research agent.
   - Configure API keys and environmental variables for services like Google Search and web scripting.

2. **Developing Functions:**
   - Create functions for Google search and website scripting, including summary functions for extensive content.

3. **Agent Configuration:**
   - Define and configure each agent with specific roles.
   - Use a user proxy agent for feedback, and a researcher agent for web browsing.

4. **Integration and Collaboration:**
   - Employ Autogen to facilitate collaboration between agents.
   - Establish group chats for agent communication and task collaboration.

5. **Testing and Operation:**
   - Test the system in controlled scenarios.
   - Adjust performance and output of agents as required.

## Data Management

- **GitHub Repository:** Utilize a GitHub repository for storing and managing research data in Markdown and CSV formats.
- **Version Control:** Keep track of changes and updates to research data efficiently.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Memory Management:** Efficiently handle information to prevent data overload.
- **Sequential Task Execution:** Ensure research tasks are performed in order for optimal results.
- **Cost Awareness:** Monitor the costs related to extensive use of OpenAI services.

## Applications

The Architect Agent and other agents that require up-to-date information not yet incorporated into the training data of current models to the Research Department.  Examples could include:
- new context management techniques
- comparative AI model performance
- new autonomous agent frameworks

## Conclusion

The Multi-Agent Research Team offers a sophisticated, flexible, and efficient solution for diverse research needs, demonstrating the capabilities of AI agents in complex research scenarios.
