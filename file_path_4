# Pull Requests

The Positron Network Architect Agent uses pull requests to manage documentation. This section provides an overview of the pull request process and its usage in the agent.

## Introduction

Pull requests are a crucial part of the agent development process. They allow for collaboration, code review, and merging of changes into the main codebase. This document provides guidance on creating and managing pull requests using the GitHub API.

## Creating a Pull Request

To create a pull request using the GitHub API, follow these steps:

1. Use the `createPullRequest` function from the GitHub API to initiate the pull request.
2. Specify the source branch and target branch for the pull request.
3. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for the pull request.
4. Commit the changes to the branch and push it to the remote repository.
5. Use the `createPullRequest` function to create the pull request on GitHub.

## Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests

Reviewing and merging pull requests is an important step in the agent development process. Here's how to do it using the GitHub API:

1. Use the `getPullRequest` function to retrieve the details of the pull request.
2. Review the changes made in the pull request and leave comments if necessary.
3. Approve the pull request if the changes meet the requirements.
4. If changes are requested, the Architect agent will make the necessary updates and the process will start over.
5. Once the pull request is approved, use the `mergePullRequest` function to merge the changes into the main codebase.

## Handling Conflicts

Conflicts may arise when merging pull requests. Here are some best practices for handling conflicts:

1. Use the `resolveConflicts` function from the GitHub API to resolve conflicts.
2. Review the conflicting files and make the necessary changes to resolve the conflicts.
3. Commit the resolved changes and push them to the branch.
4. Update the pull request with the resolved changes.

## Best Practices

To make the most out of pull requests, consider the following best practices:

- Write clear and descriptive pull request titles and descriptions.
- Assign reviewers to ensure thorough code review.
- Use labels and milestones to categorize and track pull requests.
- Leverage GitHub's review features, such as requesting specific changes or leaving inline comments.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively create, review, and merge pull requests using the GitHub API in the Positron Network Architect Agent.
