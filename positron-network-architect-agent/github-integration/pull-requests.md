# Pull Request Handling

## Overview

This document provides instructions on how to handle pull requests in the Positron Network Architect Agent repository. It covers the process of reviewing, approving, and merging pull requests.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

When reviewing a pull request, follow these steps:

1. Read the pull request description and code changes carefully.
2. Test the changes locally to ensure they work as expected.
3. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement, if necessary.
4. Approve the pull request if the changes meet the project's requirements and standards.

## Merging Pull Requests

To merge a pull request, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the pull request has been approved by at least one reviewer.
2. Resolve any conflicts between the pull request branch and the target branch.
3. Test the merged code to ensure it works correctly.
4. Merge the pull request into the target branch.
5. Delete the branch associated with the pull request, if applicable.

## Handling Pull Request Errors

If you encounter any errors or issues while handling pull requests, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the error logs and identify the specific error message.
2. Review the code changes in the pull request to identify potential causes of the error.
3. Debug the code and make necessary modifications to fix the error.
4. Test the modified code to ensure the error has been resolved.

## Unit Tests

To ensure the correctness of the pull request handling code, the following unit tests have been implemented:

- `test_review_pull_request`: Tests the review process for a pull request.
- `test_merge_pull_request`: Tests the merging of a pull request.
- `test_handle_pull_request_errors`: Tests the error handling process for pull requests.

These tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to validate the functionality of the pull request handling code.
