# Pull Requests

## Troubleshooting Failing GitHub Actions Runs

If the GitHub Actions run for a pull request is failing, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve common issues:

1. Review the error logs provided by the GitHub Actions run to identify the specific error or failure point.
2. Check the configuration of the GitHub Actions workflow file (`<workflow_file>`) to ensure it is correctly set up for the pull request.
3. Verify that the required dependencies and environment variables are properly configured for the GitHub Actions workflow.
4. Ensure that the pull request branch has the necessary permissions and access to the resources required by the workflow.
5. Test the workflow locally using the GitHub Actions runner to reproduce and debug the issue.
6. If the issue persists, consult the GitHub Actions documentation and community forums for further assistance.

## Handling Conflicts

When merging a pull request, conflicts may arise if there are conflicting changes between the source branch and the target branch. Follow these steps to handle conflicts:

1. Checkout the target branch locally: `git checkout <target_branch>`.
2. Pull the latest changes from the remote target branch: `git pull origin <target_branch>`.
3. Checkout the source branch: `git checkout <source_branch>`.
4. Merge the target branch into the source branch: `git merge <target_branch>`.
5. Resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge process.
6. Commit the resolved changes: `git commit -m "Merge <target_branch> into <source_branch>"`.
7. Push the changes to the remote source branch: `git push origin <source_branch>`.

## Resolving Merge Issues

If there are issues with the merge process, follow these steps to resolve them:

1. Identify the specific issue or error message encountered during the merge.
2. Use Git commands such as `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log` to gather more information about the issue.
3. Consult the Git documentation and community resources to find solutions for common merge issues.
4. If necessary, revert the merge commit using `git revert <merge_commit_hash>` and try the merge process again.

## Ensuring the Correct Branch is Targeted

To ensure that the correct branch is targeted for the pull request, follow these steps:

1. Double-check the branch selection when creating the pull request.
2. Verify that the pull request is targeting the intended branch in the GitHub UI.
3. If necessary, close the pull request and create a new one with the correct target branch.

Remember to always review and test your changes before merging the pull request.
