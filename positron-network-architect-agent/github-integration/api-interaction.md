# Api Interaction

The Positron Network Architect Agent interacts with the GitHub API to create and manage documentation. This section provides an overview of the API and its usage in the agent.

## GitHub API

The GitHub API is a REST API that allows developers to programmatically interact with GitHub repositories. It provides endpoints for creating and managing issues, pull requests, and other aspects of the repository.

### Authentication

The GitHub API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. This means that the agent must be authorized to access the repository before it can make any requests. The agent uses a personal access token to authenticate with GitHub. This token is stored in the agent's configuration file.

#### Fixing Failing GitHub Actions Run

If the GitHub Actions run is failing due to authentication issues, follow these steps to fix it:

1. Open the GitHub repository where the Actions are failing.
2. Go to the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets".
4. Locate the secret named "PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" and click on "Update".
5. Update the value of the personal access token with a valid token.
6. Save the changes.

### Endpoint Verification and Configuration

To check and verify the endpoints used by the agent and ensure they are accessible and properly configured, follow these steps:

The GitHub API provides endpoints for creating and managing issues, pull requests, and other aspects of the repository. The agent uses these endpoints to create and manage documentation.

## Usage

The agent uses the GitHub API to create and manage documentation. It uses the following endpoints:

- [Create Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue)
- [Create Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls#create-a-pull-request)
- [Update Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls#update-a-pull-request)

## Checking and Updating Personal Access Token

To check and update the personal access token used for authentication, follow these steps:

1. Open the GitHub repository where the agent is configured.
2. Go to the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets".
4. Locate the secret named "PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" and click on "Update".
5. Update the value of the personal access token with a new token if necessary.
6. Save the changes.

To ensure that the required endpoints are accessible and properly configured, follow these steps:
