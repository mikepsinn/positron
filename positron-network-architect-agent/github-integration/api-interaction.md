# Api Interaction

The Positron Network Architect Agent interacts with the GitHub API to create and manage documentation. This section provides an overview of the API and its usage in the agent.

## GitHub API

The GitHub API is a REST API that allows developers to programmatically interact with GitHub repositories. It provides endpoints for creating and managing issues, pull requests, and other aspects of the repository.

### Authentication

The GitHub API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. This means that the agent must be authorized to access the repository before it can make any requests. The agent uses a personal access token to authenticate with GitHub. This token is stored in the agent's configuration file.

To troubleshoot authentication issues, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the personal access token used by the agent is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the repository.
2. Check the agent's configuration file to ensure that the token is correctly configured.
3. Verify that the agent is using the correct authentication method and token when making API requests.

### Endpoints

The GitHub API provides endpoints for creating and managing issues, pull requests, and other aspects of the repository. The agent uses these endpoints to create and manage documentation.

To troubleshoot endpoint-related issues, consider the following:
1. Check the API documentation for the specific endpoint being used by the agent.
2. Verify that the agent is constructing the API request correctly, including the required parameters and payload.
3. Handle any errors or status codes returned by the API, such as rate limiting or authentication errors.

## Troubleshooting GitHub Actions Run

If the GitHub Actions run is failing, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve common issues:
1. Review the error logs provided by the GitHub Actions run to identify the specific error or failure point.
2. Check the authentication setup to ensure that the agent has the necessary permissions and access to the repository.
3. Verify that the agent is using the correct API endpoints and making the appropriate requests.
4. Test the API requests manually using tools like cURL or Postman to ensure they are working as expected.
5. If the issue persists, consult the GitHub API documentation and community forums for further assistance.
