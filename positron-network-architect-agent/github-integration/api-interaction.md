# API Interaction

## Overview

This document provides instructions on how to interact with the API of the Positron Network Architect Agent. It covers the correct usage of API endpoints, request parameters, authentication, and handling of API responses.

## API Endpoint Usage

To interact with the Positron Network Architect Agent API, you need to use the following endpoints:

- `/api/endpoint1`: This endpoint is used for [description of endpoint 1].
- `/api/endpoint2`: This endpoint is used for [description of endpoint 2].
- `/api/endpoint3`: This endpoint is used for [description of endpoint 3].

## Request Parameters

When making API requests, ensure that you provide the correct request parameters. Here are the required parameters for each endpoint:

1. `/api/endpoint1`:
   - `param1`: [description of param1].
   - `param2`: [description of param2].

2. `/api/endpoint2`:
   - `param3`: [description of param3].
   - `param4`: [description of param4].

3. `/api/endpoint3`:
   - `param5`: [description of param5].
   - `param6`: [description of param6].

## Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, include the following headers in your requests:

- `Authorization`: [description of authorization header].
- `X-Api-Key`: [description of API key header].

## Handling API Responses

When receiving API responses, make sure to handle them appropriately. Here are some guidelines:

- Check the response status code to ensure the request was successful.
- Parse the response body according to the expected format.
- Handle any error responses returned by the API.

## Unit Tests

To ensure the correctness of the API interaction code, the following unit tests have been implemented:

- `test_endpoint1_success`: Tests the successful interaction with `/api/endpoint1`.
- `test_endpoint2_failure`: Tests the failure scenario for `/api/endpoint2`.
- `test_endpoint3_params`: Tests the correct usage of parameters for `/api/endpoint3`.

These tests cover various edge cases and scenarios to validate the functionality of the API interaction code.
