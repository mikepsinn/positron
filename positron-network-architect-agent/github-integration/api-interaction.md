# Fixing Failing GitHub Actions

If you are experiencing issues with failing GitHub Actions, follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. Check for Syntax Errors:
   - Review your code for any syntax errors or typos that may be causing the actions to fail.
   - Use a code editor or linter to identify and fix any syntax issues.

2. Ensure Proper Environment Setup:
   - Verify that your GitHub Actions workflow file has the correct environment setup.
   - Check that the required software, dependencies, and versions are specified correctly.

3. Verify Dependencies:
   - Ensure that all necessary dependencies are included in your project's configuration files (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt).
   - Double-check the versions of the dependencies to ensure compatibility with your code.

4. Check Network Connectivity:
   - Confirm that your GitHub Actions runner has proper network connectivity.
   - Test network connectivity by running actions that require internet access, such as API calls or package installations.

If you have followed these troubleshooting steps and are still experiencing issues, refer to the `api-interaction.md` file for any necessary API interactions or modifications.
