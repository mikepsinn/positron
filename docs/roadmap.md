# Autonomous Self-Improvement Roadmap

1. Create the "Positron Network Architect" roadmap with granular milestones and tasks.  Provide specific technologies and APIs and external third-party tools (i.e. GitHub, Google Search, OpenAI API, etc.) that would need to be integrated with the Positron Network Architect so that it can function autonomously and achieve its mission.  At the time of this writing, it seems that 
2. Build the "Positron Network Architect" agent.
3. The Positron Network Architect agent will complete the documentation for the Positron Network in the GitHub repository in excruciating detail.  It will also create GitHub issues for any improvements that it can identify.
4. Separate "Positron Network Builder Agents" will implement all the components as they are described in the Positron network documentation

# Human Roadmap

Theorized best order of operations:
1. Make Grant
2. Hire lead engineer
3. Lead engineer solicits feedback to finalize a detailed and granular implementation roadmap
4. Create GitHub issues for each next 
5. They create modular challenge bounties
6. Operationalize autonomous agents to produce the best forkable template of an autonomous non-profit possible
7. If you guys are interested, fork a version for each of Foresight's focus areas and configure it to optimize for the specific objectives.
8. Fork the generalized autonomous non-profit template framework and customize for the FDAi, a decentralized, global agency
