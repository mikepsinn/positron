## Addiction Agent

To help address the opioid crisis, an agent could analyze medical, social, and economic data to understand the underlying factors contributing to opioid abuse, such as chronic pain management, mental health issues, and socio-economic factors. This agent could then suggest preventive measures, better pain management alternatives, and effective rehabilitation programs.
