# Positron Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

For the Positron project, effectively measuring progress and success involves identifying both lag and lead measures. Lag measures track the outcomes we're trying to achieve, while lead measures track the high-impact activities that drive those outcomes. Here's how these can be applied to the Positron project:

**Lag Measures:**
- **Number of Autonomous Agents Developed:** Tracks the cumulative total of autonomous agents created through the project.
- **Usage of Agents by Nonprofits:** Monitors how many nonprofits are actively using these agents and for what purposes.
- **Impact on Public Goods:** Measures the tangible impact of these agents on public goods, which could include metrics like improved efficiency, cost savings, or other specific outcomes relevant to each agent’s purpose.
- **Community Growth:** Tracks the growth of the community involved in the project, including developers, nonprofits, and other stakeholders.

**Lead Measures:**
- **Active Contributors:** Measures the number of active contributors to the repository, indicative of engagement and project momentum.
- **Development Activity:** Monitors the frequency and volume of contributions, pull requests, and updates to the repository, reflecting ongoing development efforts.
- **Collaboration Events Participation:** Tracks participation in Collabathons or other collaborative events, indicative of the project’s ability to engage and mobilize the community.
- **Feedback and Iteration Cycles:** Monitors the frequency and quality of feedback cycles between developers and nonprofits, ensuring that the development is aligned with real-world needs.

By focusing on these lead measures, we can influence the lag measures, which are the ultimate indicators of the project's success. Regularly reviewing and adjusting these metrics ensures that the project stays on track and continues to align with its goals.
