# Paradise Engineer Wanted
<!--
This section of the document aims to introduce the goal of creating a virtual world with pro-social AI agents and outlines the basic steps required to achieve this objective.

## Goal

In order to realize the positive vision and avoid the risks outlined in the [Gaming the Future](https://foresightinstitute.substack.com/p/start-here)
we're creating a virtual world filled with pro-social AI agents (genies) that maximize universal wish fulfillment while respecting the rights of meat.

## Just 3 Easy Steps!

1. **Learn** - Create AI representations of real-world organizations and people. Each digital twin should have its own vector database of defining data.  The most fundamental components of each entity would be its wishes and resources (data, humans, capital, etc.). These serve primarily as a source of information for other agents.

2. **Decide** - Decider agents that create hypotheses about the most efficient ways to fulfill various wishes while respecting universal human rights. They then use semi-quantitative cost benefit analysis to decide which strategies to test first.

3. **Act** - Task agents then carry out strategies and measure the results.  Given current their limitations, agents should automate what they can and outsource what they can't to humans.
