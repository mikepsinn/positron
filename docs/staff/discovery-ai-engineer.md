## Autonomous Discovery Engineer

We are seeking a software engineer to assist with the creation of autonomous AI agents to quantify the precise effects of foods, drugs, supplements, and medical interventions on human health.

### Key Responsibilities

Initially, the human Autonomous Cooperation Engineer will be responsible for the following roles, but over time, the goal is to develop autonomous AI agents to take over as many responsibilities as is feasible and desirable:

1. **Autonomous AI Agent Development**
   - Design and implement AI agents capable of autonomously working within the FDAi framework, particularly focusing on the Data Silo API Gateway Nodes, PersonalFDA Nodes, and Clinipedia.
   - Ensure these AI agents can effectively navigate and process large datasets, extract meaningful insights, and contribute to the global knowledge repository.

2. **Integration with FDAi Framework Components**
   - Develop AI agents that seamlessly integrate with the three primary components of the FDAi:
      - **Data Silo API Gateway Nodes**: Facilitate data export from various health data silos.
      - **PersonalFDA Nodes**: Import, store, and analyze health data to determine the impact of various factors on individual health.
      - **Clinipedia**: Contribute to the aggregation and analysis of data on the global platform.

3. **Enhancement of Modularity and Interoperability**
   - Focus on creating AI agents that embody the core characteristics of the FDAi – modularity, interoperability, and adherence to open protocols.
   - Ensure that the AI agents can be easily integrated into different systems and used in conjunction with a variety of health data sources.

4. **Collaborative Intelligence and Community Contribution**
   - Design AI agents to support and enhance collective intelligence efforts, encouraging collaboration and data sharing among different entities.
   - Contribute to the open-source community by sharing developments and encouraging external contributions to the AI agent's codebase.

5. **Outcome Label Analysis and Reporting**
   - Utilize AI agents to analyze and generate outcome labels as part of Clinipedia, providing valuable insights into health impacts of various products.

6. **Research and Continuous Improvement**
   - Stay updated with the latest advancements in AI, particularly in healthcare and data analysis.
   - Continually refine and enhance the AI agents based on new research, technology developments, and community feedback.

### Desired Skills and Qualifications
- Strong experience in AI and machine learning, especially in the context of data analysis and autonomous systems.
- Experience with some of the following programming languages and tools relevant to autonomous agent development (e.g., Python, JavaScript, fine-tuning pre-trained models, Autogen, AutoGPT, SuperAGI, etc.).
- Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to work collaboratively in a dynamic environment.
- Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, or a related field.
- Experience in working with open-source communities.
- Knowledge of healthcare and pharmaceutical domains.
- Strong communication and documentation skills.

### Desired Outcomes

1. **Increase in PersonalFDA Nodes**: Increase the number of people running PersonalFDA Nodes. 

2. **Data Points Donated**: Increase the number of data points donated to the FDAi framework. 

3. **Studies Generated**: Increase the number of studies generated using the data from the FDAi framework. 

4. **Articles for Clinipedia**: Increase the number of articles generated for Clinipedia. 

5. **Feedback Ratings**: Improve the quality of the articles on Clinipedia. 

6. **Data Silos Integration**: Increase the number of data silos that provide data to the PersonalFDA nodes.
