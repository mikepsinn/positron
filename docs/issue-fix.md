## Common GitHub Actions Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Workflow fails with "No valid runners found" error

**Description:** This error occurs when there are no available runners to execute the workflow.

**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient runner capacity
- Misconfigured runner labels

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check the runner status using the GitHub Actions tab in the repository settings.
2. Ensure that there are available runners and they are online.
3. Verify the runner labels specified in the workflow file.
4. If the runner labels are incorrect, update them to match the available runners.
5. If there are no available runners, consider adding more runners or adjusting the runner capacity.

### Issue 2: Workflow fails with "Permission denied" error

**Description:** This error occurs when the workflow does not have the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.

**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient permissions for the workflow
- Misconfigured access tokens

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Check the permissions of the workflow file and ensure that it has the necessary permissions to perform the required actions.
2. Verify the access token used in the workflow file.
3. If the access token is incorrect or lacks the required permissions, generate a new access token with the necessary scopes and update the workflow file.
4. If the workflow relies on secrets, ensure that the secrets are properly configured and accessible.

### Issue 3: Workflow fails with "Invalid YAML syntax" error

**Description:** This error occurs when there are syntax errors in the workflow file.

**Possible Causes:**
- Typos or incorrect indentation in the YAML syntax
- Missing or misplaced YAML keys

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Use a YAML validator or linter to check for syntax errors in the workflow file.
2. Verify the indentation of YAML blocks and ensure they are properly aligned.
3. Check for missing or misplaced YAML keys and correct them accordingly.
4. If the error persists, consider breaking down the workflow into smaller steps to identify the specific syntax issue.

### Issue 4: Workflow fails with "Timeout" error

**Description:** This error occurs when the workflow execution exceeds the specified timeout duration.

**Possible Causes:**
- Long-running processes or tasks
- Insufficient resources for the workflow

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Identify the specific step or task that is causing the timeout.
2. Optimize the step or task to reduce its execution time.
3. If the workflow requires more resources, consider increasing the allocated resources or adjusting the workflow configuration.
4. If the timeout is still occurring, consider breaking down the workflow into smaller steps or parallelizing tasks.
