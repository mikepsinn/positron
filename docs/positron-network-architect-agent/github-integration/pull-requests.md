# Pull Requests

The Positron Network Architect Agent uses pull requests to manage documentation. This section provides an overview of the pull request process and its usage in the agent.

## Pull Request Process

### Evaluating a Pull Request

After a pull request is created, it goes through the following evaluation process:
1. Automated checks - The pull request is subject to automated checks, such as code quality and test coverage.
2. Review by Architect agents - The Architect agents review the pull request and provide feedback.
3. Integration testing - The changes are tested in the integration environment to verify functionality.
4. Approval and merging - Upon successful completion of the above steps, the pull request is approved and merged into the main branch.

### Creating a Pull Request

The agent creates a pull request when it needs to update the documentation. It uses the following steps to create a pull request:

1. Create a branch for the pull request.
2. Make the necessary changes to the documentation.
3. Commit the changes to the branch.
4. Push the branch to the remote repository.
5. Create a pull request on GitHub.
6. A webhook or GitHub Action triggers a critic agent to review and critique the pull request.
7. Human feedback (optional step) - Humans can review the pull request and support or argue with the various Critic and Architect agents. If the human reviewers approve the changes, the pull request can be merged.  
8. If the human reviewers approve the changes, the pull request can be merged.
9. If the human requests changes, the Architect agent will make the changes and the process will start over. Once the changes are made, the pull request can be submitted for another round of review.
