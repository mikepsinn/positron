# Api Interaction

The Positron Network Architect Agent interacts with the GitHub API to create and manage documentation. This section provides an overview of the API and its usage in the agent.

## GitHub API

The GitHub API is a REST API that allows developers to programmatically interact with GitHub repositories. It provides endpoints for creating and managing issues, pull requests, and other aspects of the repository.

### Authentication

The GitHub API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. This means that the agent must be authorized to access the repository before it can make any requests. The agent uses a personal access token to authenticate with GitHub. This token is stored in the agent's configuration file. In case of authentication errors, users should follow the GitHub documentation to resolve them.

### Endpoints

The GitHub API provides endpoints for creating and managing issues, pull requests, and other aspects of the repository. It also includes troubleshooting steps to address failing GitHub Actions. The agent uses these endpoints to create and manage documentation.
