# Api Interaction

The Positron Network Architect Agent interacts with the GitHub API to create and manage documentation. This section provides an overview of the API and its usage in the agent.

## GitHub API

The GitHub API is a REST API that allows developers to programmatically interact with GitHub repositories. It provides endpoints for creating and managing issues, pull requests, and other aspects of the repository.

### Authentication

The GitHub API uses personal access token for authentication. This means that the agent must be authorized to access the repository before it can make any requests. The agent uses a personal access token to authenticate with GitHub. This token should be stored in the agent's configuration file. To set up and store the personal access token, add it to the agent's configuration file with the appropriate permissions.
