# Issue Labels

In project management systems used for software development, issues are typically labeled or tagged to indicate their current status and priority. These labels help teams to quickly understand the state of each issue and plan their work accordingly. Here are some common labels used for such purposes:

1. **Status Indicators:**
   - **New**: Indicates that the issue has been reported and is awaiting triage or initial assessment.
   - **In Progress**: The issue is currently being worked on.
   - **Blocked**: Signifies that the issue cannot be progressed due to external dependencies or other impediments.
   - **On Hold**: The issue is temporarily paused, perhaps due to shifting priorities or the need for further information.
   - **Closed**: The issue has been resolved, either through fixing, merging code changes, or completing the required task.
   - **Reopened**: An issue that was previously closed but has been reopened due to new developments or the discovery of related problems.

2. **Priority Indicators:**
   - **Low/Medium/High Priority**: These labels are used to indicate the urgency or importance of addressing the issue.
   - **Next Up/Up Next**: Often used in agile workflows to indicate issues that are queued up to be worked on in the next sprint or the next phase of work.

3. **Decision Labels:**
   - **Approved**: The issue or feature request has been reviewed and approved for implementation.
   - **Rejected**: The issue or request will not be acted upon, often used after review or discussion.
   - **Duplicate**: Indicates that the issue has already been reported, and this instance is a duplicate of an existing one.

4. **Type Indicators:**
   - **Bug**: A problem with the software that needs fixing.
   - **Feature**: A request for a new feature or enhancement.
   - **Task**: A general task that needs to be completed, not necessarily a software bug or a new feature.

5. **Workflow-Specific Labels:**
   - **Needs Review/Needs Testing**: Indicates that the issue or code requires review or testing before it can proceed further.
   - **Wontfix**: Used for issues that are acknowledged but will not be addressed, often due to strategic decisions or resource limitations.

6. **Contextual Labels:**
   - **Customer Reported**: Issues reported by customers, used for prioritization and tracking.
   - **Technical Debt**: Indicates work that needs to be done to clean up code and improve its structure or performance.

These labels can be customized to fit the specific workflow and needs of a software development team. They play a crucial role in managing the software development lifecycle and ensuring effective communication and organization within the team.
