# Agent Categories

At a minimum, there should be an autonomous agent definition for each of the following activities characteristic of the most effective non-profit organizations.  However, the below general activities should be customized to specifically apply to the specific mission of the nonprofit.  Here are the six behaviors characteristic of the most effective non-profits:

1. **Nonprofit Networking Agents** - These agents should support other nonprofits/Positron instances. An agent should catalog all similar nonprofit organizations/Positron instances.  It should provide a feed sharing:
   - agent definitions and efficiency 
   - opportunities to pool resources on what would normally be duplicative initiatives
   - accumulated expertise
   - talent databases
   - opportunities to vote on relevant decisions
   - real world events
2. **Collective Intelligence and Power Distribution Agents** - These agents should identify and recruit highly dedicated and intelligent human executives and board members. It should then directly communicate with these people in a concise and informative way to make collective decisions and solicit new ideas.
3. **Market Engagement Agents** - These agents discover ways to utilize the power of self-interest and the laws of economics where pure altruism is not enough. These agents find ways to help business “do well while doing good.” They influence business practices, build corporate partnerships, and develop earned-income ventures — all ways of leveraging market forces to achieve social change on a grander scale.
4. **Movement Builder Agents** - These agents should inspire evangelists. They should create meaningful ways to engage individuals in emotional experiences that help them connect to the group’s mission and core values. They see volunteers, donors, and advisers not only for what they can contribute to the organization in terms of time, money, and guidance but also for what they can do as evangelists for their cause. They build and sustain strong communities to help them achieve their larger goals.
5. **Advocacy Agents** - These agents use policy advocacy to access government resources or to change legislation, thus expanding their impact. They may establish grassroots program agents to support their strategy.

## Meta-Agents:

**Agent Evaluator** - This is more of a meta-agent should supervise and monitor the effectiveness of the other agents at advancing the mission based on their lead and lag metrics.  It should also monitor the internet for new approaches that could advance the mission. It should propose create new experimental agents with a WIG, lead, and lag measure to experiment these new approaches.  It should send the executive team and board regular reports with its evaluation and recommendations.
