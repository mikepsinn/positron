# Digital Twins

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a mirror of your mind. It is a digital representation of your knowledge, values, and preferences. It is a digital version of you that can be used to automate tasks, make decisions, and interact with other digital twins.

In short, a digital twin is an AI agent that:
- knows what you know
- wants what you want
- (eventually) does what you would do
