## Why Digital Twins?

### Intelligence Amplification (IA)

Rather than replacing human intelligence with an alien intelligence, AI should be used to amplify our own. 

The majority of problems in the world can be attributed to the fact that humans simply are not very good at making decisions. We are biased, irrational, and easily manipulated. We make decisions based on emotions rather than logic. We are prone to cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and the halo effect. We are also prone to logical fallacies such as the appeal to authority, the appeal to emotion, and the appeal to tradition.

Our brains are no different from those of cavemen. They were designed for survival in a world of scarcity of resources and information. Characteristics that were beneficial in the past, such as tribalism, gluttony, and violence could now lead to our extinction.

We finally have the opportunity to evolve our minds. We can transcend our biological limitations and become the versions of ourselves that we aspire to be.

### Protection from Totalitarianism

A singleton is an AI system that is so powerful it could destroy any less powerful potential rival AI.  A singleton could be 

Diversity is an essential characteristic of a healthy ecosystem. When an apex predator becomes too powerful, it can cause the extinction of other species. A rich diversity of AI agents aligned with individual human values is necessary to prevent a singleton from taking over the world.

### Cybersecurity

Soon criminals will be creating millions digital twins of themselves to automate their effort to drain the productive, cooperative economy of its resources.  

Relative to the cognitive abilities of future AI agents, humans will basically be babies.  We'll need agents perfectly aligned with our values to filter information, identify deep fake deception, and take proactive measures to protect us from cyberattacks.

## Other Benefits of a Word of Digital Twins

**Optimized Public Policies** - Imagine your digital twin could read every piece of legislation and ask the digital twin of every expert in the world what they thought about it. Then it could summarize all the information and tell you it thinks you should vote on it.  This would lead to better laws and less corruption.

**Optimized Career Paths** - Imagine your digital twin could go to job interviews at every company in the world and find the perfect job that paid the most and made you the happiest. 

**Optimized Foreign Relations** - Imagine the digital twin of every Palestinian and every Israeli could talk to each other. It's almost certain they could discover a better solution than blowing up each other's children.

**Optimized Health** - Imagine your digital twin could be trained on all over your health data and the health data of everyone else in the world. It could then tell you what you should eat, how much you should exercise, and what supplements you should take to live as long as possible. It could also tell you what diseases you're likely to get and what you can do to prevent them.

**Optimized Relationships** - Imagine your digital twin could go on a date with everyone else's digital twin. Instead of people marrying whoever their locker was next to in high school, they could find the best person among 8 billion people. This would lead to more happiness and less divorce.
