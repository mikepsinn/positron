# Digital Twin Data Model

For the digital twin agents to effectively simulate real-world people and assist coordination agents in formulating plans, the GitHub repository of raw data must be tailored to capture comprehensive and nuanced aspects of individuals' lives, including their wishes, resources, capabilities, and preferences. 

Here's an outline of data types that would be instrumental in achieving this:

1. **Personal and Professional Profiles:**
   - Biographical data: Basic demographic information, educational background, and work history.
   - Skillsets and expertise: Detailed information on professional skills, certifications, and areas of expertise.

2. **Behavioral and Preference Data:**
   - Psychographic data: Insights into attitudes, interests, values, and lifestyle choices.
   - Consumer behavior: Purchasing habits, brand preferences, and service usage patterns.

3. **Social and Network Data:**
   - Social media activity: Interests, opinions, and interactions as reflected on social platforms.
   - Professional networks: Connections and collaborations within professional networks like LinkedIn.

4. **Health and Wellness Information:**
   - General health data: Non-sensitive health information, wellness habits, and fitness activities.
   - Medical history: (if ethically and legally permissible) General health history for understanding healthcare needs and preferences.

5. **Goals and Aspirations:**
   - Personal goals: Short-term and long-term personal objectives, dreams, and aspirations.
   - Career ambitions: Professional growth plans and career aspirations.

6. **Resource Access and Ownership:**
   - Asset information: Data on owned resources like property, investments, and other assets.
   - Access to resources: Information about resources the individual has access to, such as community assets, familial resources, etc.

7. **Time and Availability:**
   - Schedules and availability: Typical time commitments, schedules, and periods of availability.
   - Time allocation preferences: Preferred times for various activities or engagements.

8. **Geographical and Locational Data:**
   - Current location: Geographical data to understand the local context and opportunities.
   - Mobility patterns: Information on typical travel patterns and mobility preferences.

9. **Cultural and Ethical Considerations:**
   - Cultural background: Information on cultural affiliations and practices.
   - Ethical preferences: Insights into ethical and moral standpoints, which can be crucial in decision-making.

10. **Communication Styles and Preferences:**
    - Preferred communication modes: Preferred ways of communication (e.g., email, phone, messaging).
    - Language proficiency: Information on language skills and preferences.

To ensure accuracy and respect for privacy, it's crucial to source this data ethically, possibly with consent where personal data is involved. This comprehensive data will allow the digital twin agents to simulate real-world people accurately, enabling the coordination agents to understand their wishes, resources, and capabilities. This, in turn, will facilitate the formulation of efficient plans and task assignments, both for automation and for delegation to the most suitable real-world counterparts, thereby achieving shared goals more effectively.
