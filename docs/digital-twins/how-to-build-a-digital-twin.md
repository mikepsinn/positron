# How to Create Your Digital Twin

Create a repository to store your digital twin's [defining data](digital-twin-data-model.md).
This will be your [Digital Twin Safe](digital-twin-safe.md).
It will contain all the data that defines who you are and what you want.  

This data is then used to personalize foundational large language models (with RAG and/or fine-tuning) to make them mirror you as closely as possible.
