# Self-Improving GitHub Repository

The goal is to turn this project is to create a self-improving GitHub repository. 

Humans can guide and control the direction by contributing to the documentation, creating/commenting on GitHub issues, and reviewing/merging pull requests.

However, the Project Manager Agent will continuously monitor the state of the code and create issues to address any functional deficiencies.  These issues can be addressed through code contributions by Builder Agents.

Humans review the code contributions and can reject, request changes, or merge them into the main branch if they are acceptable.
