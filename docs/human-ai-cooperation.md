# Mechanism for Human-AI Cooperation

Given the limitations of current AI technology, it's important to consider how humans and AI can work together to achieve the Positron Network's mission. This human-AI cooperation mechanism is designed to leverage the strengths of both humans and AI, while mitigating their weaknesses.

The mechanism for human-AI cooperation in the Positron Network, uses GitHub issues and pull requests to blend human insights with AI's capabilities. This approach allows for effective collaboration, leveraging the strengths of both humans and AI in the network's development and maintenance. Here's how it works:

**1. Issue Creation and Identification:**
   - **AI-Generated Issues:** The AI, like the Positron Network Architect Agent, identifies potential enhancements or issues within the network. It then creates GitHub issues detailing these findings.
   - **Human-Generated Issues:** Network participants (developers, non-profit staff, etc.) can also create issues on GitHub to suggest changes, report bugs, or propose new features.

**2. AI Analysis of Issues:**
   - The AI reviews and analyzes both AI-generated and human-generated issues.
   - It prioritizes them based on predefined criteria such as impact, feasibility, and alignment with the network's goals.

**3. Human-AI Discussion:**
   - **Collaborative Deliberation:** For each issue, there's a collaborative discussion involving both humans and the AI. The AI can provide data-driven insights, simulations, or projections to inform the discussion.
   - **Feedback Integration:** Humans provide contextual understanding, ethical considerations, and strategic direction. They can offer feedback on the AI's suggestions and analyses.

**4. Pull Request Creation:**
   - **AI-Driven Development:** For issues where AI can autonomously develop solutions (e.g., code optimizations, documentation updates), the AI creates a pull request with the proposed changes.
   - **Human-Driven Development:** For more complex or sensitive changes, human developers make the necessary modifications and submit pull requests.

**5. Review and Merging:**
   - Pull requests are reviewed by both humans and AI.
   - **Human Review:** Humans ensure that the changes align with the overall mission, adhere to ethical standards, and are pragmatically sound.
   - **AI Review:** The AI can perform automated tests, code analysis, and impact simulations.
   - Once approved, the changes are merged into the main branch of the repository.

**6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**
   - The AI learns from human feedback and decisions made on issues and pull requests, refining its future contributions and analyses.
   - Human participants also gain insights from AI-generated data and recommendations, enhancing their decision-making processes.

**7. Documentation and Transparency:**
   - All discussions, decisions, and changes are documented transparently on GitHub.
   - This ensures a clear audit trail and allows for broader community engagement and oversight.

This human-AI cooperation mechanism facilitates a synergistic relationship where AI enhances human capabilities with data-driven insights and automation, while human participants provide contextual intelligence, creativity, and ethical guidance. GitHub, as a platform, offers an ideal environment for this collaboration, with its APIs and tools for issue tracking, code review, and version control.

## Meetings

SCRUM and Sprint Planning meetings should be transcribed using a service like Fireflies.ai and sent to the Project Manager Agent to turn action items into GitHub Issues and the Documentation Agent to update documentation files in the repository.

### SCRUM Meetings

These should be daily 15-minutes strictly time-limited meetings focused on answering the questions:
1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What are you doing today?
3. What do you need to succeed today?

### Weekly Sprint Planning Meetings

Weekly sprint planning meetings are 1-hour meetings held at the start of each week. The team:
1. discuss the work to be done in the upcoming sprint
2. breaks larger tasks into smaller, manageable tasks
3. assign them to team members

## Human Project Manager

A human AI engineer will be responsible for:
1. Coordinating between the various non-profits to ensure the project is aligned with their needs
2. Creating a detailed roadmap for the project
3. Running SCRUM and Sprint Planning meetings
4. Ensuring that meeting transcripts are converted to GitHub Issues and Documentation
5. Creating GitHub Issues for the tasks that need to be completed
6. Creating bounties for the tasks that need to be completed
7. Answering questions from contributors from 9 to 5 PST Monday through Friday
8. Respond to GitHub Issues and Pull Requests within 24 hours on weekdays
9. Facilitate collaborative resource allocation decisions through the use of quadratic funding, participatory budgeting, and retroactive public goods funding

## Automated Task Outsourcing

For tasks that can't be completed by the Positron Network agents, the Outsourcing Agent will be used to outsource tasks to other humans or organizations. The Outsourcing Agent will be responsible for:
1. Creating GitHub Issues for the tasks that need to be completed
2. Creating bounties for the tasks that need to be completed
3. Answering questions from contributors
